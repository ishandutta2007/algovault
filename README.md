## Algovault
A collection of algorithms, data structures and templates for competitive programming.

In a nutshell, these are the goals of this project:
  1. Useful in online competitions like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam).
  2. Simple to use as a black-box without compromising performance.
  3. Example usage and sufficient documentation.

Most codes are written in C/C++, majority should work with C++11 and some might require C++14 or higher. Some algorithms are written in Python. For Python, use Python 3. Most codes should be compatible with PyPy too.

Most implementations are stress-tested and cross-checked against various problems. Nonetheless they are not guranteed to be flawless and work in all cases.

For bugs, refactoring and improvements, feel free to file an issue or a pull request as contributions are always welcome.

## The Zen Of Contributing
Inspired from [The Zen Of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id2)

```python
Beautiful is better than ugly

Simple is way better than complex

Consistency matters

Flat is preferred over nested

Typing is better than incomprehensible macros

Because readability counts

But not as much as speed

Some documentation is better than no documentation

No documentation is better than extensive documentation

But not as important as ease of reusing as a black box

Four spaces are better than tabs

Tabs are better than no spaces

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea

Namespaces are one honking great idea, let's do more of those!
```

## Future Work
1. This is still a work in progress so I'll port more code from my template over the time
2. Add stress tests, automated unit tests and integration tests
3. Refactor and simplify old implementations
4. Add practice problems
5. Add a comprehensive index
